# f-FERM: Scalable Fair Empirical Risk Minimization via f-divergences
f-FERM is a fair machine learning framework that uses f-divergences as the measure of fairness violation. f-divergences cover many previously measures for evaluating the group fairness violation such as KL-divergence, Chi Square divergence, and total variations. Furthermore, it reformulates the fair empirical risk minimization as a min-max problem such that the gradient estimator of the loss function is available. Therefore, the algorithms shows a convergent behavior for any batch size as small as 1.
